# Sandbox
## Getting started
- Clone the repo with the `--recursive` flag && don't give it another folder name (devcontainer depends on it)
``` bash
git clone git@github.com:42core-team/sandbox.git  --recursive
```
- reopen in devcontainer
- run
  - `make` to see visualizer output
  - `make debug` to see the bots output
  - `make visualizer` to only run the visu at any point
